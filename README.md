ðŸŽ€ Vanity-Role-Bot

This is a Discord bot that automatically assigns and removes roles to members based on their custom status. When a member sets a specific keyword in their status (defined in the bot's configuration), the bot assigns them a role, and when they remove it, the bot removes the role.
